# Roku_Part_I

Description 


#Roadmap: 
Part 1

This stage will focus on the initial design and prototyping, as well as scaffolding and project setup.
For the planning and research process, we decided to take a look on different platforms like Netflix, 
Amazon Prime, Roku, among others.
Our app should be user friendly, what odes mean is that it will be intuitive for the user. 
 

#Requirements Per Role
Designer
Design the look and feel of a mobile-first web application based on the supplied brief (Roku
Flashback). Creatively this project is wide open - push yourself to explore the latest trends in
mobile-first design. Consider the end user; focus on engaging UX and UI.
Refer to the design documentation (provided) and begin your layout(s) accordingly. At this point
they can contain a lot of For Position Only (FPO) artwork, screen shots, sketches etc. - you DO
NOT need to have the final finished artwork developed at this point. However at the end of the
fall term you should be at the point where you can convert your sketches / artwork into a
finished prototype fairly quickly.
Using the program of your choice, assemble your ideas into page layouts and submit .jpg or .pdf
files for each design deliverable (refer to the Roku design document).

#Developer
Create the proper project stucture including a Github repo / readme. Think about the new
project workflow weâ€™re exploring in class and adhere to it as closely as you can.
Create a Dev Notes document on Drive (or somewhere similar) and plan out your project
development path. Think of this like a Wiki / roadmap - express your ideas on paper first (digital
or otherwise) so that you have something to refer to if you lose your way.
